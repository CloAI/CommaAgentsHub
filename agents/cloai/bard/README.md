# BardAgent Documentation 📘

## Overview 🌐
Bard, Google's Language Learning Model (LLM), is a powerful and intelligent AI tool. We use the `bardapi` module for interacting with the Bard LLM through its API. Remember, `bardapi` isn't the official Google API, but it's quite effective, utilizing your cookie storage and session key to access Google APIs.

## Notes 📌
- **Default Session Key**: If a `bard_session_key` is not provided when you initialize a BardAgent, the system defaults to using the `_BARD_API_KEY` environment variable.

## Example Usage 🚀

```python
from comma_agents.hub.cloai.bard import BardAgent

# Initialize a BardAgent instance
my_bard_agent = BardAgent("MyAgentName")

# Crafting a question for Bard
question = "How will AI evolve in the next decade?"

# Getting a thoughtful response from Bard
response = my_bard_agent._call_llm(question)

# Revealing Bard's insights
print(f"Bard's Insight: {response}")
```

In this example, you'll see how to set up a BardAgent, pose a question to Bard, and receive an AI-powered response. It's a straightforward and effective way to gain insights from Google's Bard LLM using the BardAgent.
